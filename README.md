### About this Repo

This repo contains the final code for the **Prompt Library** application build in the course. The `reference-project` branch is the application demonstrated at the beginning of the course. The commits on the `main` branch are the progress checks while for the application build during the course.

### Features

Title and content fields — form to enter prompt title and content
Save to localStorage — prompts are saved in the browser's localStorage
Display all prompts — saved prompts are shown in a card layout
Delete prompts — each prompt has a delete button with confirmation
Dark mode styling — dark theme with blue accents
Responsive design — works on desktop and mobile

### How to use

Open index.html in Live Server (right-click → "Go Live" or use the Live Server extension)
Enter a title and content for your prompt
Click "Save Prompt" to save it
View all saved prompts in the right column (or below on mobile)

The application uses localStorage, so your prompts persist between sessions. Clearing browser data will remove them.
